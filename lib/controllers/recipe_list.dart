            'If you only associate Salisbury steak with frozen TV dinners, we’ve got a happy surprise. Made right, as in this recipe, the comfort-food special deserves a spot on your weeknight table. Juicy, tender hamburgers cook in a generous mushroom and onion gravy that has surprisingly complex flavors for something you whip up in a few minutes. All you need to add is a big dollop of mashed potatoes. The recipe is a Yummly original created by [Ashley Strickland Freeman](https://www.yummly.com/dish/author/Ashley-Strickland-Freeman).'),

            'These savory Mexican empanadas are made with a mixture of masa harina, baking powder, and a touch of flour that cooks up light, crispy, and flavorful when pan-fried. Note that you’ll need a tortilla press for making them. But if you are short on time, some stores sell frozen empanada shells that you can simply fill, seal by pressing with a fork, and bake according to package instructions. Either way, you’ll love the tasty combination of sauteed mushrooms and chorizo with melty cheese. It’s a perfect office or picnic lunch because the empanadas travel well and no silverware is needed. The recipe, which makes 8 empanadas, is a Yummly original created by [Ericka Sanchez](https://www.yummly.com/dish/author/Ericka-Sanchez).'),

            "You may have seen tubs of muhammara (or mhammara) in grocery stores alongside hummus, but did you know it’s easy to make at home, and even more delicious than the store-bought kind? A revered dip in the Middle East, muhammara is known for its punch of flavor. Roasted peppers and walnuts make a fruity, nutty base for tangy pomegranate molasses, which you can find at well-stocked grocery stores. Enjoy muhammara with warm pita bread, or (though it’s not traditional), with vegetable sticks, as a sandwich spread, and alongside eggs or potatoes.
